### Unit 5 | Assignment - The Power of Plots

## Data Analysis & Conclusions

• Capomulin is the only drug which showed a significant decrease in tumor volume during treatment. Infubinol and Ketapril nearly mirrored the placebo in terms of the tumor volume actually increasing during treatment.<br>
• Capomulin treatment resulted in the fewest number of metastatic sites during treatment.<br>
• Capomulin treatment resulted in significantly higher survival rates among the mice. Infubinol actually performed worse than the Placebo treatment in terms of survival rates, with Ketapril coming in nearly equal to the placebo.<br>

## Part 2: Pymaceuticals

While your data companions rushed off to jobs in finance and government, you remained adamant that science was the way for you. Staying true to your mission, you've since joined Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego, CA. Pymaceuticals specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As their Chief Data Analyst, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. Your objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

To do this you are tasked with:

• Creating a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.<br>
• Creating a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each       treatment.<br>
• Creating a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)<br>
• Creating a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.<br>

Here is an example of one scatter plot:<br>

# Considerations
•Your scatter plots must include error bars. This will allow the company to account for variability between mice.<br>
•Remember when making your plots to consider aesthetics!<br>
•Your legends should not be overlaid on top of any data.<br>
•Your bar graph should indicate tumor growth as red and tumor reduction as green.<br>
•It should also include a label with the percentage change for each bar.<br>

# Programs Used: 

• Pandas<br>
• Jupyter<br>
• Matplotlib<br>
